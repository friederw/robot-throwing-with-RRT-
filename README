To try this project out, just run the function auto_test() .

Tested with MATLAB 7.11.0.584 R2010b on Mac OS X Snow Leopard

planed future features:
----------------------

- grow multiple RRT's incl. backwards simulation
    - how to do backward simulation?
        - euler 1
        - runge kutta and minmizing difference with u
    - all throws should be at 45 deg (grow RRTs from there with different velocity)

- better criterion for throw and one sided throws only

- compliance in the joints

- 2 DOF and higher      

- use gravity
